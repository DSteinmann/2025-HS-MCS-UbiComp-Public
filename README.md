This is the public repo for the MCS UbiComp Course

## Assignment 1: Onboard vs Offboard Data Analytics

In this assignment, students use a Puck.js
device and a pre-trained ML model to classify device movements as one of three
gestures.


## Assignment 2: Gaze-based Augmented Reality

In this assignment, students gain experience working with gaze-based AR.
Concretely, you will build a system that, in Task 1, can learn how to 
estimate activities from eye tracking data (offline, i.e., from existing data). 
In Task 2, the system should be able to work with online data and estimate 
user activity within a time frame. Following the activity recognition, 
in Task 3, the system should be able to provide contextual suggestions on an AR display.


## Assignment 3: Decentralized Data Handling


In this assignment, students interact with a SoLiD server, 
create their own Pod, share resources (data) with others, 
and create a Mixed Reality application that uses such resources.
