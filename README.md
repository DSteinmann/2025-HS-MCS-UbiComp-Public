This is the public repo for the MCS UbiComp Course

## Assignment 1: Onboard vs Offboard Data Analytics

In this assignment, students use a Puck.js
device and a pre-trained ML model to classify device movements as one of three
gestures.


## Assignment 2: Gaze-based Augmented Reality

In this assignment, students gain experience working with gaze-based AR.
Concretely, students build a system that can learn how to estimate activities 
from eye tracking data and, following the activity recognition, can provide 
contextual suggestions on an AR display.


## Assignment 3: Decentralized Data Handling


In this assignment, students interact with a SoLiD server, 
create their own Pod, share resources (data) with others, 
and create a Mixed Reality application that uses such resources.
